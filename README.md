I didn't modify the structure of this program from the original creator, I just added a whole bunch of comments to better describe it. As a newbie to C#, this turned out to be a great example to learn from, but it was way harder than it should've been to get a handle on how it worked since there were no comments in the actual code. This is my attempt to remedy that. PR's welcome!
